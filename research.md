                                    <p>Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a branch of NLP that focuses on mapping linguistic forms onto a representation of their meanings. It involves the analysis of textual language to extract meaning, intent, context, and relationships between words and phrases. NLU has diverse applications, including but not limited to Named Entity Recognition (NER), Sentiment Analysis, Intent Recognition, Relationship Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Text Classification, Question Answering and many more.</p>

Among the notable challenges in this domain is addressing low-resource languages (LRLs), characterized by limited available data or resources. Our research group is dedicated to the advancement of modeling frameworks that facilitate cross-lingual/multilingual transfer across various NLP tasks, specifically focusing on LRLs. Our primary objective is to create efficient and effective solutions that can be practically applied in real-world multilingual scenarios. We have achieved notable progress in enabling zero-shot technologies for several LRLs by employing methodologies such as language structure analysis, cross-lingual transfer learning, meta-learning, and other innovative approaches.   </p>

        In this space we work on event, disaster and other related problems. With the growth of social media platforms, event-related tweet retrieval has become an important research area in information retrieval. The challenge lies in identifying tweets that are related to a specific event and filtering out irrelevant or noise tweets. Techniques such as query expansion, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis have been used to improve the effectiveness of event-related tweet retrieval. Such techniques have applications in areas such as disaster management, political analysis, and marketing research.</p>

These systems have become increasingly popular in e-commerce, social media, and content streaming platforms. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two main approaches to building recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering uses the past behavior of users and item ratings to recommend new items, while content-based filtering uses item attributes and user preferences to make recommendations. Hybrid approaches that combine both methods have also been developed to improve the accuracy of recommendations. </p><p>
    One of the focused area for our research group is event recommendation systems. It aims to suggest events to users based on their preferences, interests, and location. These systems can benefit both users and event organizers, by increasing attendance and engagement. Techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models have been used in event recommendation systems. Challenges in this area include cold-start problem, diversity, and scalability.</p>

                    <p>Social network analysis is the study of social structures using network and graph theories. It involves examining how individuals or entities are connected and how information or resources flow through these connections. This field has applications in various domains, including sociology, marketing, healthcare, and counter-terrorism. Techniques such as centrality measures, community detection, and link prediction are commonly used to analyze social networks and identify patterns and insights from the data. Social network analysis has become increasingly important with the rise of online social media platforms and the need to understand their impact on society.<br>

                    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models that operate on graphs or networks. They have shown great promise in a wide range of applications, including social networks, recommendation systems, and drug discovery. GNNs can learn node and edge representations that capture the structural and semantic information of the graph, allowing for more accurate predictions and efficient processing. However, challenges remain in training and interpreting GNNs, particularly in the context of large, complex graphs with noisy or incomplete data. Ongoing research in this field aims to address these challenges and advance the development and deployment of GNNs in practical applications.<br>
    Onc application which GNN  has explore for  disaster management. The GNN have shown great potential for this field, particularly in tasks such as damage assessment, resource allocation, and evacuation planning. GNNs can effectively model the complex relationships between different entities such as buildings, roads, and people, and capture the dependencies between them. By analyzing and predicting the impact of natural disasters using GNNs, emergency responders and policymakers can make informed decisions that can potentially save lives and minimize damage. However, further research is needed to develop GNN-based approaches that can handle the dynamic and uncertain nature of disaster scenarios.</p>

                    Image captioning is the task of generating a textual description of an image. This is a challenging task that requires both computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Typically, an image captioning system takes an image as input and generates a sentence or a short paragraph that describes the contents of the image. Image captioning has various applications, such as assisting visually impaired individuals and improving image retrieval systems. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have shown promising results in image captioning.
