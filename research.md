<h3 onclick="toggle_visibility('item9');" style="color: blue; cursor: pointer;">2. Information Retrieval</h3>
<div id="item9" style="display:none;">
    <p class="content" style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px;">Information retrieval is the process of retrieving relevant information from a large collection of data, such as documents or web pages. The goal is to provide users with a ranked list of documents that are most relevant to their query. The field of information retrieval encompasses various techniques, including indexing, query processing, and ranking algorithms. Information retrieval has applications in many areas, including search engines, recommendation systems, digital libraries, and e-commerce. <br>
    In this space we work on event, disaster and other related problems. With the growth of social media platforms, event-related tweet retrieval has become an important research area in information retrieval. The challenge lies in identifying tweets that are related to a specific event and filtering out irrelevant or noise tweets. Techniques such as query expansion, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis have been used to improve the effectiveness of event-related tweet retrieval. Such techniques have applications in areas such as disaster management, political analysis, and marketing research.</p>

<h3 onclick="toggle_visibility('item10');" style="color: blue; cursor: pointer;">3. Recommendation System</h3>
<div id="item10" style="display:none;">
    <p class="content" style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px;">Recommendation systems are a type of information filtering system that provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and past behaviors. These systems have become increasingly popular in e-commerce, social media, and content streaming platforms. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two main approaches to building recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering uses the past behavior of users and item ratings to recommend new items, while content-based filtering uses item attributes and user preferences to make recommendations. Hybrid approaches that combine both methods have also been developed to improve the accuracy of recommendations. <br>
    One of the focused area for our research group is event recommendation systems. It aims to suggest events to users based on their preferences, interests, and location. These systems can benefit both users and event organizers, by increasing attendance and engagement. Techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models have been used in event recommendation systems. Challenges in this area include cold-start problem, diversity, and scalability.

<h3 onclick="toggle_visibility('item11');" style="color: blue; cursor: pointer;">4. Social Network Analysis</h3>
<div id="item11" style="display:none;">
    <p class="content" style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px;">Social network analysis is the study of social structures using network and graph theories. It involves examining how individuals or entities are connected and how information or resources flow through these connections. This field has applications in various domains, including sociology, marketing, healthcare, and counter-terrorism. Techniques such as centrality measures, community detection, and link prediction are commonly used to analyze social networks and identify patterns and insights from the data. Social network analysis has become increasingly important with the rise of online social media platforms and the need to understand their impact on society.<br>
    We work on these problems ----</p>

<h3 onclick="toggle_visibility('item12');" style="color: blue; cursor: pointer;">5. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)</h3>
<div id="item12" style="display:none;">
    <p class="content" style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding: 10px;">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models that operate on graphs or networks. They have shown great promise in a wide range of applications, including social networks, recommendation systems, and drug discovery. GNNs can learn node and edge representations that capture the structural and semantic information of the graph, allowing for more accurate predictions and efficient processing. However, challenges remain in training and interpreting GNNs, particularly in the context of large, complex graphs with noisy or incomplete data. Ongoing research in this field aims to address these challenges and advance the development and deployment of GNNs in practical applications.<br>
    Onc application which GNN  has explore for  disaster management. The GNN have shown great potential for this field, particularly in tasks such as damage assessment, resource allocation, and evacuation planning. GNNs can effectively model the complex relationships between different entities such as buildings, roads, and people, and capture the dependencies between them. By analyzing and predicting the impact of natural disasters using GNNs, emergency responders and policymakers can make informed decisions that can potentially save lives and minimize damage. However, further research is needed to develop GNN-based approaches that can handle the dynamic and uncertain nature of disaster scenarios.</p>
