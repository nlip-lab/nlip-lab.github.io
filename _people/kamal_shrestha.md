### Bio
<p style="text-align: justify">
In my academic pursuits, I am currently engaged in the development of a heuristic-based recommendation engine that is designed to serve as a job recommendation engine to the platform, <a href="http://swarajability.org/">Swarability</a>, catering specifically to differently-abled individuals. The primary aim of this platform is to provide a range of odd jobs that are tailored to the individual's physical abilities, with the end goal of enhancing their employment opportunities and overall quality of life.

<!--### Research Interests

Felipe is a PhD candidate in Neuroscience under Konrad Kording and Michael Platt. He studies the neural basis of social primate grooming and spends his time building deep learning-based tools to analyze natural primate behavior and wirelessly recorded neural data. Felipe also studies how we can  use deep reinforcement learning approaches (imitation learning and inverse RL) to model animal strategies in social contexts.
