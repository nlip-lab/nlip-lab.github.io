### Bio: 
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student interested in novel contributions to the field of Natural language processing (NLP). Prior to joining Ph.D., I have experience building data resources and processing tools for the low-resource language Bodo. I have also explored machine translation and identification of tonal words and their meaning from the textual data for the Bodo language. I'm currently exploring various other sub-fields of NLP to make a valuable contribution to the field. 

### Research Interests:
